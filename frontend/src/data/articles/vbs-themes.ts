<h2>What Makes VBS Special</h2>
<p>Vacation Bible School is often the biggest outreach event a church does all year. For many kids, it's their first — and sometimes only — exposure to the gospel. The energy, the music, the activities, and the community make VBS unforgettable. And unforgettable is exactly where you want the gospel to live.</p>

<h2>Planning Your VBS Schedule</h2>

<h3>Sample Daily Schedule (3-Hour Format)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>0:00-0:20</strong> — Opening rally: high-energy worship, theme introduction, skit</li>
<li><strong>0:20-0:45</strong> — Bible story time (large group or small group, depending on size)</li>
<li><strong>0:45-1:15</strong> — Craft station (themed craft connected to the day's lesson)</li>
<li><strong>1:15-1:30</strong> — Snack break (themed snacks if possible)</li>
<li><strong>1:30-2:00</strong> — Game time (outdoor or gym, high-energy)</li>
<li><strong>2:00-2:20</strong> — Music/worship (practice the VBS song, teach motions)</li>
<li><strong>2:20-2:40</strong> — Small group discussion/application (age-specific)</li>
<li><strong>2:40-3:00</strong> — Closing rally: recap, announcements, dismiss</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rotation vs. Large Group Model</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rotation model:</strong> Kids move in groups between stations (crafts, games, Bible story, music). Works well for 50+ kids. Requires more volunteers but keeps energy high.</li>
<li><strong>Large group model:</strong> Everyone together for the main session, then split for age-specific activities. Works for smaller churches. Fewer volunteers needed.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid:</strong> Large group opening and closing, rotation for the middle portion. Best of both worlds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Volunteer Coordination</h2>

<h3>Key Roles You Need</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>VBS Director:</strong> Overall coordination, schedule, communication</li>
<li><strong>Bible Story Leader:</strong> Teaching the daily lesson (your strongest communicator)</li>
<li><strong>Worship Leader:</strong> Music, motions, energy (doesn't need to be a professional — enthusiasm counts more than talent)</li>
<li><strong>Craft Coordinator:</strong> Pre-cuts and preps all crafts, manages supplies</li>
<li><strong>Game Leader:</strong> Runs outdoor/gym activities, manages equipment</li>
<li><strong>Snack Team:</strong> Prepares and distributes snacks (check allergies!)</li>
<li><strong>Small Group Leaders:</strong> One per 5-8 kids, same leader all week for relationship building</li>
<li><strong>Registration/Check-in:</strong> Safety, attendance, parent communication</li>
<li><strong>Decor Team:</strong> Set up the week before, maintain during the week</li>
</ul>

<h3>Volunteer Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recruit teens.</strong> High schoolers make fantastic VBS helpers — they have energy, kids look up to them, and it builds their leadership skills.</li>
<li><strong>Train in one meeting.</strong> Hold a single 90-minute training session the week before. Walk through the schedule, hand out materials, answer questions.</li>
<li><strong>Over-recruit by 20%.</strong> People get sick, have emergencies, or forget. Plan for no-shows.</li>
<li><strong>Feed your volunteers.</strong> Provide snacks, coffee, lunch. Fed volunteers are happy volunteers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making VBS an Outreach Event</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make it free.</strong> Remove every barrier to attendance. Cover costs through church budget or donations.</li>
<li><strong>Advertise widely.</strong> Flyers at schools, social media, neighborhood door hangers, word of mouth. Start promoting 6 weeks out.</li>
<li><strong>Welcome unchurched families.</strong> Many VBS kids have never been to church. Make the environment welcoming, not intimidating. No insider language.</li>
<li><strong>Host a family night.</strong> On the last evening, invite parents. Do a short showcase of what kids learned, share the gospel, and invite families to Sunday services.</li>
<li><strong>Follow up.</strong> Within one week of VBS ending, contact every family. Invite them to church. Ask how their kids enjoyed the week. Relationship, not just event.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Budget-Friendly Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skip the expensive curriculum box.</strong> Create your own theme using free resources, Bible Lesson Planner, and volunteer creativity. The best VBS comes from passion, not a price tag.</li>
<li><strong>Reuse decor.</strong> Many themes share common elements — streamers, butcher paper, string lights. Store and reuse year to year.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for donations.</strong> Craft supplies, snacks, and decorations can often be donated by church members.</li>
<li><strong>Partner with other churches.</strong> Small churches can combine resources for a joint VBS with bigger impact and shared costs.</li>
