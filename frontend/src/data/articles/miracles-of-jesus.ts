<h2>More Than Magic</h2>
<p>Jesus' miracles weren't magic tricks to impress crowds. Each one was a sign — a revelation of who He is, what He cares about, and what God's kingdom looks like when it breaks into our world. When Jesus healed the sick, He was showing us a world where suffering ends. When He fed thousands, He was declaring Himself the bread of life.</p>
<blockquote><strong>John 20:30-31 (NIV)</strong> — "Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples... But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God."</blockquote>

<h2>Healing Miracles</h2>

<h3>The Paralyzed Man Lowered Through the Roof (Mark 2:1-12)</h3>
<p>Four friends couldn't get through the crowd, so they dug through the roof and lowered their friend to Jesus. Jesus' first words? "Your sins are forgiven." Then He healed the paralysis to prove He had authority over both.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Faith sometimes means creative persistence. And Jesus cares about our souls even more than our bodies.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching tip:</strong> For kids, focus on the friends' determination. For teens, discuss what it means that Jesus addressed sin before physical healing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Woman Who Touched His Cloak (Mark 5:25-34)</h3>
<p>Twelve years of bleeding, every doctor, every penny spent. She touched the edge of His garment in a crowd and was instantly healed. Jesus stopped everything to find her — not because He needed to know who touched Him, but because she needed to be seen.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Jesus doesn't just heal — He restores dignity. He called her "daughter" and sent her in peace.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching tip:</strong> This is powerful for anyone who feels invisible or ashamed. Jesus stops for the person everyone else overlooks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ten Lepers Healed (Luke 17:11-19)</h3>
<p>Jesus healed ten lepers. Only one came back to say thank you — and he was a Samaritan.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Gratitude is the proper response to God's grace. Nine received healing; one received a relationship.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching tip:</strong> Great for teaching thankfulness. "What has God done for you that you might be taking for granted?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nature Miracles</h2>

<h3>Calming the Storm (Mark 4:35-41)</h3>
<p>The disciples were professional fishermen — they knew storms. This one terrified them. And Jesus was asleep. They woke Him in panic. He spoke three words: "Quiet, be still." The sea obeyed instantly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key lesson:</strong> The same Jesus who sleeps peacefully in your storm has the power to silence it with a word. His peace isn't ignorance — it's authority.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching tip:</strong> Ask: "What storms are you facing? How does it change things to know Jesus is in the boat with you?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Walking on Water (Matthew 14:22-33)</h3>
<p>Jesus walks on the lake during a storm. Peter asks to join Him and actually does — until he looks at the waves instead of Jesus. He sinks, cries out, and Jesus immediately catches him.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Peter's failure wasn't getting out of the boat — it was taking his eyes off Jesus. And even when he sank, Jesus was right there.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching tip:</strong> For teens: "What does it look like to step out in faith? What 'waves' make you lose focus?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Feeding the 5,000 (John 6:1-15)</h3>
<p>Five loaves. Two fish. A boy's lunch. Jesus fed over 5,000 people with twelve baskets left over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Jesus doesn't need much to do miracles — He needs your willingness to offer what you have. The boy could have kept his lunch. He gave it instead.</li>
<li><strong>Object lesson:</strong> Bring five crackers and two gummy fish. Ask: "Is this enough to feed the class?" Discuss what happens when we give God our "not enough."</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>John 6:35 (NIV)</strong> — "Then Jesus declared, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry.'"</blockquote>

<h2>Resurrection Miracles</h2>

<h3>Raising Lazarus (John 11:1-44)</h3>
<p>Jesus' friend Lazarus died. Jesus wept — even knowing what He was about to do. Then He stood at the tomb and called, "Lazarus, come out!" A dead man walked out, still wrapped in burial cloths.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Jesus has authority over death itself. And He weeps with us in our grief — His power doesn't diminish His compassion.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching tip:</strong> "Jesus wept" (John 11:35) is the shortest verse in the Bible and one of the most profound. God is not distant from our pain.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Jairus' Daughter (Mark 5:21-43)</h3>
<p>A synagogue leader begged Jesus to heal his dying daughter. By the time Jesus arrived, she was dead. "Don't be afraid; just believe," Jesus said. He took her hand: "Little girl, I say to you, get up." She stood up and walked around.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key lesson:</strong> It's never too late for Jesus. What looks like the end to us is just the beginning for Him.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching tip:</strong> The tenderness of Jesus here — calling her "little girl," telling the parents to feed her — shows His gentle care alongside His power.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Ultimate Miracle: The Resurrection</h2>
<p>Every miracle pointed to this one. On the third day after His crucifixion, Jesus rose from the dead — not resuscitated, but resurrected into a new, glorified body. The empty tomb is the foundation of the entire Christian faith.</p>
<blockquote><strong>1 Corinthians 15:17 (NIV)</strong> — "And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins."</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Because Jesus conquered death, death no longer has the final word for anyone who trusts in Him.</li>
<li><strong>Teaching tip:</strong> Don't rush past the cross to get to the empty tomb. The resurrection means everything because the crucifixion cost everything.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Teaching Miracles Well</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Focus on who Jesus is, not just what He did.</strong> Miracles reveal His character — compassion, authority, love, power. The "wow" factor is secondary to the "who" factor.</li>
<li><strong>Don't skip the context.</strong> Why was the woman bleeding for 12 years significant? What did leprosy mean socially? Context turns a story into a revelation.</li>
<li><strong>Address doubt honestly.</strong> Some students will wonder "Why doesn't Jesus do miracles like that today?" Don't dismiss the question. Engage it with honesty and Scripture.</li>
<li><strong>Connect to daily life.</strong> "You may not need Jesus to calm a literal storm, but what storms in your life need His peace?"</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Greatest Miracle</h2>
<p>While healing the sick and feeding thousands are stunning, Jesus Himself pointed to a greater miracle: transformed hearts. Zacchaeus the corrupt tax collector becoming generous (Luke 19). The Samaritan woman at the well becoming an evangelist (John 4). Peter the denier becoming the rock of the Church (Acts 2). Every miracle Jesus performed pointed to His ultimate work — making dead hearts alive and broken people whole. That miracle is still happening today.</p>
