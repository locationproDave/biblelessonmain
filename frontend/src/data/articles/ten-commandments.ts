<h2>The Foundation of God's Law</h2>
<p>The Ten Commandments aren't just ancient rules — they're God's design for how life works best. Given to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 20), they reveal God's character and His vision for human flourishing. The first four address our relationship with God; the last six address our relationships with each other.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Exodus 20:1-2 (NIV)</strong> — "And God spoke all these words: 'I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.'"</blockquote>
<p>Notice: God introduces Himself as deliverer before He gives commands. The commandments aren't about earning God's love — they're the response of people already loved and rescued.</p>

<h2>1. No Other Gods (Exodus 20:3)</h2>
<p><em>"You shall have no other gods before me."</em></p>
<p>God deserves first place — not because He's insecure, but because nothing else can bear the weight of being your ultimate thing. Anything we put in God's place will eventually crush us.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "What's the most important thing in your life? God wants to be #1 — not because He's bossy, but because He loves you most."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Discuss modern "gods" — popularity, grades, relationships, social media followers. "What would you be devastated to lose? That might be your god."</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. No Idols (Exodus 20:4-6)</h2>
<p><em>"You shall not make for yourself an image..."</em></p>
<p>An idol is anything we create to represent or replace God. In the ancient world, that was statues. Today, it's subtler — we make God in our image instead of letting Him define Himself through His Word.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Object lesson:</strong> Show pictures of ancient idols, then modern "idols" (phone, trophy, money). The materials change but the temptation doesn't.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> "How do people create a version of God that's more comfortable than the real God?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Don't Misuse God's Name (Exodus 20:7)</h2>
<p><em>"You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God."</em></p>
<p>This goes beyond casual swearing. It's about treating God's name — His reputation, His character — with the weight it deserves. Using God's name to manipulate, lie, or trivialize is the deeper violation.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "God's name is special. We use it to talk to Him and about Him — not as a throwaway word."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Explore what it means to represent God's name well as someone who claims to follow Him. "When people see how you live, what do they think about God?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Remember the Sabbath (Exodus 20:8-11)</h2>
<p><em>"Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy."</em></p>
<p>God built rest into the fabric of creation — not because He was tired, but because we need it. Sabbath is a weekly declaration that the world doesn't depend on your productivity.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "God made a special day for resting and spending time with Him. Even God rested!"</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Challenge the hustle culture. "Is your schedule unsustainable? God designed you to stop. That's not lazy — it's trust."</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Honor Your Parents (Exodus 20:12)</h2>
<p><em>"Honor your father and your mother."</em></p>
<p>The first commandment with a promise attached. Honoring parents isn't about blind obedience — it's about respect, gratitude, and recognizing the authority God has placed in our lives.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> Specific examples — "Honoring means obeying the first time, speaking respectfully, and saying thank you."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> This gets complicated when parents aren't perfect. Discuss the difference between honoring and agreeing with everything. "You can honor someone and still set healthy boundaries."</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive note:</strong> Be aware that some students have absent, abusive, or difficult parents. Handle this commandment with compassion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Do Not Murder (Exodus 20:13)</h2>
<p><em>"You shall not murder."</em></p>
<p>Jesus expanded this in Matthew 5:21-22 to include anger and contempt. The commandment protects the sanctity of human life — every person is made in God's image.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "Every person is precious to God. We protect life, not hurt it."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Explore Jesus' teaching — hatred, cruel words, and dehumanizing others violate the spirit of this command. "How do your words affect the people around you?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Do Not Commit Adultery (Exodus 20:14)</h2>
<p><em>"You shall not commit adultery."</em></p>
<p>God designed marriage as a covenant — a sacred, exclusive commitment. This commandment protects the trust and faithfulness at the heart of that relationship.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "God wants families to be strong and loving. He designed marriage to be a special promise."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Discuss faithfulness, commitment, and God's design for relationships without shaming. Focus on the beauty of the design, not just the prohibition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Do Not Steal (Exodus 20:15)</h2>
<p><em>"You shall not steal."</em></p>
<p>Respect for others' property reflects respect for others' dignity. Stealing says "my desires matter more than your rights."</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> Simple and clear — taking what isn't yours is wrong, even small things.</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Expand to include cheating, plagiarism, pirating, and taking credit for others' work. "What are ways people steal without thinking of it as stealing?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Do Not Lie (Exodus 20:16)</h2>
<p><em>"You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor."</em></p>
<p>Truth is the foundation of trust. When we lie — even small lies — we erode the fabric of our relationships and communities.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Object lesson:</strong> Squeeze toothpaste onto a plate. Ask a volunteer to put it back in the tube. "That's what happens with lies — once they're out, you can't take them back."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Discuss gossip, exaggeration, and "white lies." "Is there such a thing as a harmless lie?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Do Not Covet (Exodus 20:17)</h2>
<p><em>"You shall not covet..."</em></p>
<p>The only commandment that addresses the heart directly. Coveting is wanting what someone else has — their stuff, their life, their success. It's the root that feeds stealing, lying, and every other sin.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "Being thankful for what you have is the opposite of coveting. When you're grateful, you don't need what someone else has."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Social media is a coveting machine. "Instagram shows you everyone else's highlight reel. How does scrolling affect your contentment?"</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>Philippians 4:11-12 (NIV)</strong> — "I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances."</blockquote>

<h2>Teaching the Ten Commandments as a Series</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>10-week series:</strong> One commandment per week with real-world application and a memory challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Two tablets:</strong> Teach the structure — Commandments 1-4 (loving God) and 5-10 (loving people). This maps directly to Jesus' summary in Matthew 22:37-39.</li>
<li><strong>Not about earning salvation:</strong> Always emphasize that the law shows us our need for grace, not how to earn God's love. The gospel is the context for the commands.</li>
<li><strong>Jesus' fulfillment:</strong> Show how Jesus fulfilled and deepened each commandment in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7).</li>
</ol>
