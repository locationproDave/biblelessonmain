<h2>The Most Important Week in History</h2>
<p>Easter isn't a single Sunday — it's the climax of a week that changed everything. Walking students through Holy Week day by day builds anticipation, deepens understanding, and makes Resurrection Sunday truly explosive.</p>
<blockquote><strong>1 Corinthians 15:3-4 (NIV)</strong> — "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."</blockquote>

<h2>Palm Sunday — The Triumphal Entry</h2>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Jesus rides into Jerusalem on a donkey. Crowds wave palm branches and shout "Hosanna!" — meaning "Save us!" They expected a conquering king. They got a suffering servant. The same crowd would shout "Crucify Him!" five days later.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> Wave real or paper palm branches. Shout "Hosanna!" together. Then explain: "The people wanted Jesus to be a certain kind of king. But Jesus had a different plan — a better plan."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Discuss the fickleness of crowds. "Have you ever been praised one day and rejected the next? Jesus knows that feeling."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Monday-Wednesday — Tension Builds</h2>
<h3>Key Events</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jesus clears the Temple</strong> — overturning tables of money changers. "My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers" (Matthew 21:13).</li>
<li><strong>Religious leaders plot against Him</strong> — Jesus' popularity threatens their power.</li>
<li><strong>Jesus teaches in parables</strong> — the wicked tenants, the wedding banquet — each one a warning to those who reject Him.</li>
<li><strong>Judas agrees to betray Jesus</strong> for thirty pieces of silver.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Teaching Tip</h3>
<p>These middle days build the tension that makes Friday devastating and Sunday glorious. Don't skip them. "Something is coming. The danger is growing. Jesus knows exactly what's ahead — and He walks toward it, not away."</p>

<h2>Maundy Thursday — The Last Supper</h2>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Jesus gathers His disciples for a final meal. He washes their feet — a slave's job — modeling servant leadership. He breaks bread: "This is my body." He lifts the cup: "This is my blood of the covenant, poured out for many." Then He goes to Gethsemane to pray, sweating drops of blood, asking if there's another way — but ultimately surrendering: "Not my will, but yours."</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> Demonstrate foot washing with a willing volunteer. Explain that the most powerful person in the room did the lowest job. "Jesus shows us that real leaders serve."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Focus on Gethsemane. Jesus was honest about His fear and pain. "Even Jesus asked 'Is there another way?' Being afraid doesn't mean you lack faith. It means you're human."</li>
<li><strong>Activity:</strong> Share communion-style bread and juice together (check with your church's guidelines). Explain what it represents.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>Luke 22:42 (NIV)</strong> — "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."</blockquote>

<h2>Good Friday — The Cross</h2>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Betrayed by Judas. Denied by Peter. Abandoned by His friends. Unjustly tried. Beaten. Mocked. Nailed to a cross between two criminals. "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" And then: "It is finished."</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids (age-appropriate):</strong> Focus on the "why" more than the graphic details. "Jesus chose to go to the cross because He loves us so much. He took the punishment we deserved so we could be forgiven."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Don't sanitize it. The cross was brutal, public, and shameful. Jesus endured the worst thing humans could do — and responded with "Father, forgive them." That's the gospel.</li>
<li><strong>Activity:</strong> Give each student a nail. Have them hold it during a moment of silence. "This is what it cost."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Saturday — The Silent Day</h2>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Nothing. Silence. Jesus is in the tomb. The disciples are hiding, grieving, terrified. Everything they believed has been shattered. There is no hope.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<p>This is the most overlooked day — and one of the most powerful. "Sometimes life feels like Saturday. The answer hasn't come. The miracle hasn't happened. God feels silent. Saturday teaches us that God is working even when we can't see it."</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> "Have you ever been in a 'Saturday' season — where God feels absent and nothing makes sense? What did you learn? What sustained you?"</li>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "Imagine how sad the disciples were. They didn't know Sunday was coming. But we do — and that changes everything."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resurrection Sunday — He Is Risen!</h2>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Early morning. Women go to the tomb. The stone is rolled away. An angel declares: "He is not here; He has risen!" Mary Magdalene sees Jesus and doesn't recognize Him until He says her name. The disciples come running. Over the next 40 days, Jesus appears to over 500 people.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> Build the anticipation all week so Sunday is the payoff. "JESUS IS ALIVE!" should feel like the greatest news they've ever heard — because it is.</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Address the evidence. The empty tomb, the eyewitnesses, the transformation of the disciples from cowards to martyrs. The resurrection isn't a fairy tale — it's the most well-attested event in ancient history.</li>
<li><strong>Activity:</strong> Resurrection eggs — plastic eggs containing symbols of Holy Week (bread, nail, cloth, stone, empty). Open one per day or all on Sunday as a recap.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>Matthew 28:5-6 (NIV)</strong> — "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said."</blockquote>

<h2>Easter Lesson Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build the full arc.</strong> Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday is a seven-day story. Don't just do Sunday — the cross means more when you've walked through the week.</li>
<li><strong>Don't skip the darkness.</strong> The joy of Easter is proportional to the grief of Friday. Let students sit in the sadness before you rush to the celebration.</li>
<li><strong>Make it personal.</strong> "Jesus didn't just die for the world — He died for you. If you were the only person on earth, He would have done it all for you."</li>
<li><strong>Celebrate big.</strong> Easter Sunday should feel different — decorations, special music, treats, joy. If there's one Sunday to go all out, this is it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Beyond Easter Sunday</h2>
<p>The resurrection isn't just a one-day event — it's the foundation of everything we believe. Consider extending your Easter series into the weeks following, covering Jesus' post-resurrection appearances: walking with the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35), restoring Peter at the beach (John 21), and commissioning the disciples before ascending (Matthew 28:18-20). These stories show that the risen Jesus didn't just prove He was alive — He immediately got to work restoring, teaching, and sending His followers into the world.</p>
