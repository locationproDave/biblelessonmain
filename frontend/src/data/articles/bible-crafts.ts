<h2>Craft Tips for Teachers</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prep everything in advance.</strong> Pre-cut shapes for younger kids. Have supplies organized and ready.</li>
<li><strong>Always connect to the lesson.</strong> Explain the "why" before starting. "We're building this shield because..."</li>
<li><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> The fanciest craft isn't the best craft. The one kids can actually do (and feel proud of) is.</li>
<li><strong>Budget-friendly supplies:</strong> Dollar stores, paper bags, recyclables, and nature items (rocks, leaves, sticks) cover most projects.</li>
<li><strong>Let them take it home.</strong> Crafts become conversation starters with parents — extending your lesson beyond Sunday.</li>
</ol>
