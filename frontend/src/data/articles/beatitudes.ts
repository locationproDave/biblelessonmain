  html: `
<h2>The Most Revolutionary Speech Ever Given</h2>
<p>Jesus sat on a hillside overlooking the Sea of Galilee and described a kingdom that turned every human value system on its head. The poor are blessed. The grieving are comforted. The meek inherit the earth. In eight statements, Jesus redefined what it means to be truly fortunate.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Matthew 5:1-2 (NIV)</strong> — "Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them."</blockquote>

<h2>Blessed Are the Poor in Spirit (Matthew 5:3)</h2>
<p><em>"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."</em></p>
<p>This isn't about money. "Poor in spirit" means recognizing your spiritual bankruptcy — knowing you need God desperately. It's the opposite of self-sufficiency. The kingdom belongs to people who know they can't earn it.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "Have you ever needed help and couldn't do it alone? God loves it when we say 'I need you.' That's what poor in spirit means."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Contrast with cultural messages of self-reliance. "The world says 'believe in yourself.' Jesus says 'believe in Me.' Which is harder? Which is more honest?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blessed Are Those Who Mourn (Matthew 5:4)</h2>
<p><em>"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted."</em></p>
<p>Mourning here includes grief over loss but also grief over sin and the brokenness of the world. Those who feel the weight of what's wrong are promised comfort — not a pat answer, but the presence of God Himself.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "When you're sad, God is close. He doesn't say 'stop crying.' He says 'I'm right here.'"</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Discuss grief honestly — loss of a loved one, a friendship, a dream. "It's okay to mourn. Jesus wept too (John 11:35)."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blessed Are the Meek (Matthew 5:5)</h2>
<p><em>"Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth."</em></p>
<p>Meekness is not weakness. It's strength under control — power that chooses gentleness. Moses was called the meekest man on earth (Numbers 12:3) — and he faced down Pharaoh. Jesus called Himself meek (Matthew 11:29) — and He flipped tables.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Object lesson:</strong> Show a horse with a bit and bridle. A horse is incredibly powerful — meekness is that power submitted to a rider's direction. It's not about being weak; it's about being controlled.</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> "In a world that rewards aggression and self-promotion, what does it look like to be meek at school? At home? Online?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blessed Are Those Who Hunger and Thirst for Righteousness (Matthew 5:6)</h2>
<p><em>"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled."</em></p>
<p>Jesus' audience knew real hunger and thirst — not "I skipped lunch" hunger, but survival-level need. To hunger for righteousness with that intensity means wanting God and His ways more than anything else.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "Think about how thirsty you get after playing outside on a hot day. God wants us to want Him that much."</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> "What do you hunger for most? Popularity? Success? Comfort? What would it look like to want God's way more than those things?"</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>Psalm 42:1 (NIV)</strong> — "As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God."</blockquote>

<h2>Blessed Are the Merciful (Matthew 5:7)</h2>
<p><em>"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy."</em></p>
<p>Mercy is not giving people what they deserve. It's compassion in action — choosing grace when you have every right to choose punishment.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "When someone does something wrong and you forgive them instead of getting them back — that's mercy. And God does that for you every day."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Discuss the parable of the unmerciful servant (Matthew 18:21-35). "How does receiving God's mercy obligate us to show mercy to others?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blessed Are the Pure in Heart (Matthew 5:8)</h2>
<p><em>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God."</em></p>
<p>Purity of heart means undivided devotion — not perfection, but sincerity. A pure heart isn't one that never sins; it's one that doesn't pretend, doesn't perform, and genuinely seeks God.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Object lesson:</strong> Muddy water in a jar. Let it sit — the dirt settles and the water becomes clear. "When we stop churning and get quiet before God, our hearts become clearer."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> Contrast with hypocrisy. "Jesus' biggest frustrations were with religious people who looked good outside but were corrupt inside. Purity is an inside job."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blessed Are the Peacemakers (Matthew 5:9)</h2>
<p><em>"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."</em></p>
<p>Not peace-keepers (avoiding conflict) but peace-makers (actively building reconciliation). This requires courage — stepping into tension and working toward resolution.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "A peacemaker helps people stop fighting and start understanding each other. You can be a peacemaker at school, at home, and with your friends."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> "How do you respond to conflict? Do you avoid it, escalate it, or try to resolve it? Peacemaking is active — it costs something."</li>
<li><strong>Real-world:</strong> Discuss peacemakers they admire — historical or personal. What did it cost them?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blessed Are the Persecuted (Matthew 5:10-12)</h2>
<p><em>"Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."</em></p>
<p>Jesus ends with the hardest one. Following Him may cost you — friendships, reputation, comfort, even safety. But the reward is the same as the first beatitude: the kingdom of heaven. Full circle.</p>
<h3>Teaching It</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For kids:</strong> "Sometimes doing the right thing means other people don't like you. That's okay. God sees, and He's proud of you."</li>
<li><strong>For teens:</strong> "Where does standing up for your faith cost you? What does low-level 'persecution' look like at your school?" Be real — most Western teens won't face prison, but they face mockery, exclusion, and pressure to conform.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>Matthew 5:12 (NIV)</strong> — "Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you."</blockquote>

<h2>Teaching the Beatitudes as a Series</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>8-week series:</strong> One beatitude per week. Start each week by reviewing the previous ones — they build on each other.</li>
<li><strong>The upside-down kingdom:</strong> Frame the whole series around Jesus flipping the world's values. Make a two-column chart: "The world says blessed are..." vs. "Jesus says blessed are..."</li>
<li><strong>Personal reflection:</strong> Each week, ask students to identify which beatitude they most need to grow in. Keep a journal throughout the series.</li>
<li><strong>The big picture:</strong> The Beatitudes aren't a to-do list — they're a portrait of Jesus Himself. He is poor in spirit, merciful, pure in heart, a peacemaker. As we become like Him, these qualities emerge naturally.</li>
</ol>
